Proteus simulation help

- The project is prepared for 1m by 1m firing zone, where the cannon
  is placed at the center, so, if you enter coordinates with their
  magnitude greater than 0.5 you might not get a good result of theta
  (angle from the ground).

- The length of the cannon barrel is 0.1m, so, if you enter two
  coordinates with square_root(x^2 + y^2) less than 0.2m (danger zone
  for the cannon itself), you might not get a good result.

- In the MATLAB simulation, you will get "Out of Range!" message for 
  situations like above. 

- If the simulation is not working, try to add the hex file by double
  clicking the PIC18F43K22 model.

- Cannon.X is the project folder for MPLAB
