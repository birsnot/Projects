MATLAB physics simulation functions discription

CannonDeg - used to simulate the results from Proteus simulation(to
	    test whether it hits the target or not)

CannonXY - used to simulate the total system using the approximated 
	   functions(to test whether the approximation is erroneous)

tani - used to approximate tan inverse function. It will be called 
       inside CannonXY function. The same function is used inside
       the microcontroller.


- To turn on and off the trajectory of all 4 simulations you can uncomment
  and comment codes:
 	%     plot(sx,sy,'b-'); hold on % on/off trajectary
	%     plot(tx,ty,'b-'); hold on; %on/off trajectary
