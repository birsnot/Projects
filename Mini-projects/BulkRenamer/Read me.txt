This program is used rename many files with the same substring at once.
For instance some browsers when downloading they replace any space with "%20", and some sites add thier site name at the end of a file.
If we download many files it would be time wasting to rename all the files to thier orginal name.
This is one of the situations when this program comes in handy.
